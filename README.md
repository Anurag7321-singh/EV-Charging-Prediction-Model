- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

Includes:
- EV station usage logs  
- Time and weather-related features  

## ðŸš€ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Forecasting EV charging demand  
- Visualizations and result summary  

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- MAE, RMSE, RÂ² Score  
(*Add metrics here after training*)
