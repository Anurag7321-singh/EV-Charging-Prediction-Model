# EV-Charging-Prediction-Model

A machine learning project focused on forecasting electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using real-world data.

## 📌 Problem Statement
With the rising number of EVs, power grids need smarter planning. This project predicts EV charging demand to help optimize infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost / LightGBM
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
We use real-world datasets from sources such as:
- Government energy databases
- EV station usage logs
- Weather or time-series data

## 🚀 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Time-series forecasting or regression models
- Performance evaluation
- Real-world scenario simulation

## 📈 Model Performance
(You can add graphs or a short summary of accuracy, RMSE, etc. once training is done)

## 🔧 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anurag7321-singh/EV-Charging-Prediction-Model.git
cd EV-Charging-Prediction-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
